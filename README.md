# Applied Data Analytics Program - Introduction Materials 
This repository contains introduction materials for the Applied Data Analytics Program. It contains 3 R Jupyter Notebooks and 2 PDF files that walk through SQL queries. The R files walk through basic operations such as loading libraries, reading in data sets, working with data frames, joins, visualizations, and using R with SQL. The 2 SQL files walk through running basic queries, conditional statements, case when statements, aggregations, and joins.

The data used for these files are Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data.These are public-use data sets containing information about employers and employees. Information about the LEHD Data can be found at https://lehd.ces.census.gov/.
