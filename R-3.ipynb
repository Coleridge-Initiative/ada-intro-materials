    "In this notebook, we provide a short demonstrate of how you might use R and SQL together. Generally, you want to store and handle data using SQL, but do more sophisticated analyses in R. To utilize the benefits of both, we might start exploring and getting basic summaries using SQL (using something like DBeaver, for example), but move to R once you decide what subset you want to work with. This notebook provides the background of how that interface might happen.\n",
